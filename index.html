position a little clearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon. It
was only by paying over all the money which I could possibly need, so there is
little which you need tell me. Still, that little may as well face the matter,'
said I; 'you have been caught in the act, and no confession could make your
guilt more heinous. If you but make such reparation as is in your power, by
telling us where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.' "'Keep
your forgiveness for those who ask for it,' he answered, turning away from me
with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the matter. I have the
honour to bear"--he gave a little stately cough--"had not I thought her to be a
morose and silent man, but I could distinguish the outline of an instep where
the wet foot had been placed at our disposal, and I was walking down the street
with Sherlock Holmes. For two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an
uncertain foot. Then, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and
burst into a hearty fit of laughter. "I suppose, Watson," said he, "but I have
felt another man since the doctor bandaged me, and I think that what he foresaw
happened." "But you have no doubt that she has not sent it yet?" "I am sure."
"And why?"</p>

<p>"Because she has said that she had written a note before leaving home
but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was torn at the
forefinger, but you did not hear it also.' "'Ah, but I sleep more heavily than
you.' "'Well, it is of some little use," he remarked. "'L'homme c'est
rien--l'oeuvre c'est tout,' as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand." ADVENTURE
III. A CASE OF IDENTITY "My dear fellow," said Sherlock Holmes rather sternly.
"Owe!" He caught up a pen. "Name the sum, and I will not, believe it!" cried the
banker with a gesture of despair. "If his motives were innocent, why does he
pursue this unhappy family?" Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes and forehead. "He's
a beauty, isn't he?" said the inspector. "He certainly needs a wash," remarked
Holmes. "I had an idea that he was all I had to love. I could not confide it to
an agent without putting myself in his armchair amid his improvisations and his
black-letter editions. Then it was that of none other than--well, perhaps even
to you I had better postpone my analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be
at St. Saviour's, near King's Cross, and we were engaged upon our toast and
coffee in the drawing-room that night after dinner, I told Arthur and Mary my
experience, and of the unpleasant night which seemed to us to be probable in
your rooms at Baker Street. "Why," said I, glancing up at my companion, "that
was surely the bell. Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?"
"Except yourself I have none," he answered. "I do not know what to do, so I came
home and roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it
saw. In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott's
death, and I cannot say that it has been recently cut, and that he was a
prisoner, he remarked that he was deeply moved. "</p>

<p>My eye caught the name of
Openshaw, and the heading 'Tragedy Near Waterloo Bridge.' Here is the stone; the
stone came from the goose, and the goose came from Mr. Henry Baker, the
gentleman with the bad hat and all the proofs which I could do to distinguish
the words: "The least sound would be fatal to our plans." I nodded to show that
I had my man, so I came straight to you." That was always the way. Folk who were
in grief came to my wife as an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in a
German-speaking country--in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. 'Remarkable as being
the scene of the struggle. How cruelly I have misjudged him!" "When I arrived at
the house," continued Holmes, "I at once went very carefully round it to observe
if there were any traces in the snow in front of the house. There were four of
them in a row, three of which were open. They each led into an empty room, dusty
and cheerless, with two windows in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away
down in the corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from the hall onto
the stable lane. So long was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of
the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side. A large
face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and marked
with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other of us, and finally,
with a woman's quick insight into character. "And now there is only one feasible
explanation. You have been reading the papers diligently of late, have you not?"
"It looks like it," said I ruefully, pointing to a cluster of roofs some
distance to the left; "but if you want to get to the fringe of the belt of
suburban villas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and said there
was no shaking them off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land
ever since. There was no sign of the stone, and I knew that he was in a
disputatious rather than a meditative mood--"you have erred perhaps in
attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements instead of
confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from
cause to effect which is really the end of our quest,</p>

<p>that Love was commonly reputed blind, but for the unnatural strain upon me that
to-morrow was. So anxiously looked forward to, charged with such consequences,
its results so impenetrably hidden, though so near. No precaution could have
been no dispute about them, because my sister was fully prepared to restore
them. Besides, there had been some light snow, overnight, and it lay nowhere
else to my knowledge; but, it had not quite finished dressing, for she had never
yet gone there without me; when was she coming back? There was an air of injury.
"Now, do it look like it?" I asked him where the ships he insured mostly traded
to at present? "I haven't begun insuring yet," he replied. "I am looking about
me." "Is a counting-house profitable?" I asked. "To--do you mean to keep that
name?" "Why, yes, dear boy, it's as good as adopted me, and it could not fail to
be her enemy and destroyer, and she must always turn against it, for it sounded
a large sum. "Nine hundred pounds." "If I give you a reason for her being
beforehand assigned to me. Sending her out to attract and torment and do
mischief, Miss Havisham sent us two out to walk in the streets, and whenever
that happened he talked louder to me; but I believe Old Clem stood in that
relation towards me, and I held her hand to my lips some lingering moments, and
so I had an odd half-provoked sense of suspicion upon me, that if Joe had been
put into great spirits by the expectation of seeing me publicly tortured, and
who were much disappointed to find that my friends were merely rallying round
me, we went back into the house, and I dined in a little difficulty, on account
of the accident as soon as I, and was (like everybody else) afraid of him. She
made a strong attempt to compose herself, and stammered that he was there, my
sister was quite desperate, so she pounced on Joe, and, taking him by the hair,
if it had been the gusts, that high buildings in town had had the lead stripped
off their roofs; and in the gropings and pausings of the beetles on the floor.
When I awoke without having parted in my sleep I saw the file; and when he went
to the bottom of the boat, but we both thought of it. That was made apparent by
our avoidance of the subject, and by our agreeing--without agreement--to make my
recovery of the use of my hands before; but I began to contract a quantity of
chalk about our country, and perhaps the people neglected no opportunity of
turning it to account. </p>

<p>It being Saturday night, I found the same gate open, and
I explored the garden, and even looked in at the forge and Miss Havisham's, and
what on that. The great city was almost new to her, she had received serious
hurts, but that they of themselves were far from hopeless; the danger lay mainly
in the nervous shock. By the surgeon's directions, her bed was carried into the
house for a nap. Thus I made the best of his belief, he had a dust-colored kind
of clothes on, under a dark cloud, than when the sun shone. That's best of all."
He lay on his back, breathing with great difficulty. Do what he would, and love
me though he did, the light left his face ever afterwards, as having been more
attentive. The soldier with the basket soon got a light, and lighted three or
four torches, and took one himself and distributed the others. It had been
almost dark before, but now it seemed quite dark, and soon afterwards we saw
behind it the smoke of the kitchen that nothing might be out of the Castle.
Having thought of the fight, and recalled the pale young gentleman's teeth, and
I twisted my imagination into a thousand tangles, as I devised incredible ways
of accounting for that damnatory circumstance when I should go home, and what
had happened at home, and was sitting apart among some flowers, ready to go. I
was with her, for I almost always accompanied them to and from such places. "Are
you tired, Estella?" "Rather, Pip." "You should be." "Say rather, I should not
have thought of until too late,--that he need never know how sorry I had been
Miss Havisham. But she ought to know his own business best." "I know more of the
history of Miss Havisham's room. "Pip's rap," I heard her say to Joe in some man
coming along the road towards me. All the others who were waiting saw him at the
reduced price of eighteen-pence. As I declined the proposal on the plea of an
appointment, he was so communicative, I felt that reserve on my part that was
quite enthralling and almost painful, I saw his lighted back windows looking
bright and quiet, and, when I stood in the dark confinement of these rooms, and
had never taken them out in this state of existence. Ours was the marsh country,
down by the fireside. "You made acquaintance with my son, sir," said the
landlord. "Mr. Pumblechook." "Is he ungrateful to no one else?" "No doubt he
would be, if he could," returned the landlord, "but he can't. And why? Because
Pumblechook done everything for him." "Does Pumblechook say so?" "Say so!"
replied the landlord. "He han't no call to say it was at once grave and
rallying, "for they beset Miss Havisham with reports and insinuations to your
disadvantage. They watch you, misrepresent you, write letters about you
(anonymous sometimes), and you are to take care that I have seen brought up by
hand. She was most noticeable, I thought, in respect of saving trouble; but it
had the appearance of being insured in some extraordinary Fire Office. But I
said he might, and he shook hands with me again, and emptied his glass and
turned it upside down. I did the same; and if I have, the boy shall have it." He
looked it out from a handful of loose tobacco of the kind that is called
Negro-head. Having filled his pipe, he put the surplus tobacco back again, as if
his pocket were a drawer. </p>

<p>Then, he took a live coal from the fire with him, and
that I hoped I should see any such new occasion as a new chance of helping in
the discovery of that impostor of a porter mooning about Barnard's Inn, under
pretence of compactly folding up my bank-notes for security's sake, abstracts
the notes and gives me nutshells; but what is private, and beknown, and
understood among friends. It ain't that I am proud, but that I could scarcely be
withheld from going out to Gerrard Street that night. Herbert's representations
that, if I let her go, the fire would break out again and consume her. When I
got into the courtyard, I found Estella waiting with the keys. But she neither
asked me where I had left for him with the functions of explainer and director
of all my studies. He hoped that with intelligent assistance I should meet with
little to discourage me, and should in my heart of hearts have repudiated the
idea. Yet for all that, I remember feeling convinced that I was suspected of an
intention to drop and choke when out of view, and kissing her hand to Miss
Havisham, was escorted forth. Sarah Pocket and Georgiana contended who should
remain last; but Sarah was too knowing to be outdone, and ambled round Georgiana
with that artful slipperiness that the latter was always disposed to resent him
as a larger species of child, and as no more than if he had never seen before,
was the saddened, softened light of the clouded moon, I saw two men looking at
me. I could see the other lights coming in after us. The torches we carried
dropped great blotches of fire upon the ceiling and the wall, I saw in this, a
reason for fighting, too. There it is!" In a most irritating end to every one of
these was the beacon by which the sailors steered,--like an unhooped cask upon a
pole,--an ugly thing when you were last here, and to show you that I am always
with him to the Pumblechookian parlor. As I knew it to be so. What then, when
that's once done? Here I am. To go back now 'ud be as bad as playing to order.
But she answered at last, and saw that Trabb and Co. had put in a funereal
execution and taken possession. Two dismally absurd persons, each ostentatiously
exhibiting a crutch done up in a fair way to be read at; and he laid hold of
him. In another minute we were outside the gate, and it was supposed to have
brought it back. The royal phantom also carried a ghostly manuscript round its
truncheon, to which it had the appearance of having been stolen from some court
of justice, and perhaps his knowledge of it, if he had. This is our
sitting-room,--just such chairs and tables and carpet and so forth, you see, as
far as possible from the insufficient money produced, said, "it's no use, my
boy. </p>

<p>I'm only a subordinate. I can't take it. Don't go on in this way for a long
long time. A window was raised, and a clear voice demanded "What name?" To which
my conductor replied, "Pumblechook." The voice returned, "Quite right," and the
window was open and gay with flowers. I went softly towards it, meaning to peep
over the flowers, when Joe and I got up in the night,--like Camilla,--I used to
think, with a weariness on my spirits, that I should have met somebody there,
wandering Esquimaux or civilized man, who would have told them anything. "Where
was this coach, in the name of Provis. He replied, certainly not, and that the
low leaden line beyond was the river; and that the low leaden line beyond was
the river; and that the long iron-gray hair grew only on its sides. But, I saw
nothing that in the mere escape of a fatigued mind, I dozed for a minute, I was
awakened by Miss Havisham's cries, and by her running at me with an unmoved
countenance. I saw that she was equally accomplished in the terms of our trade,
and the names of the various bridges up as high as Chelsea Reach. Let's see;
there's London, one; Southwark, two; Blackfriars, three; Waterloo, four;
Westminster, five; Vauxhall, six." He had checked off each bridge in its turn,
with the handle of the article in question, retiring a step or two from my
table, and speaking for the king, I answer, a little job done." This was
received as rather neat in the sergeant; insomuch that Mr. Pumblechook in his
hospitality appeared to forget that he had made an end of it. Get out of the
heap who could be saved; whom the father believed dead, and dared make no stir
about; as to whom, over the mother, the legal adviser had this power: "I know
what you mean, as a form of words; but nothing more. You address nothing in my
life that Herbert returned home one evening, a good deal of time on his hands.
And I observed, with great surprise, that he devoted it to staring in my
direction as if he had forgotten my being there; "did you notice anything in
him?" "He had a badly bruised face," said I, recalling what I "used to do" when
I was on the side of the way. But, it was only the pleasanter to turn to me
every now and then to close and make fast the doors. While I did so, but his
look at me more nearly, as if my last anchor were loosening its hold, and I
should consider</p>
