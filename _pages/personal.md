I am from [Patna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patna), capital city of state [Bihar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar), India. I have spent most of my initial days in [Kumhrar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumhrar), a residential area of Patna, as well as a place of historical importance.

I went to [Ramakrishna Mission Vidyapith, Deoghar](http://www.rkmvdeoghar.org/) a boarding school located in the temple town Deoghar, for my secondary education. It is one of the schools run by a social service organization named [Ramakrishna Mission](http://www.rkmhq.org/). I developed a taste for science & mathematics during my secondary education and I decided to take engineering as my career.

In order to pursue engineering studies I went to [IIT Kharagpur](http://iitkgp.ac.in/) and opted to study [Electronics engineering](http://www.ecdept.iitkgp.ernet.in/). IIT Kharagpur, better known as 'IITKgp' or simply 'KGP', is a place of all round development rather than only academic. I was proud resident of [Patel Hall](http://www.patelians.org/), residents of which are sometimes also referred as *Patelians*. Along with curricular studies, I also got interested in diverse applications of [image- and signal-processing](/ugprojects/). I became member of Computer Vision group of KRAIG (Kharagpur Robotics & Artificial Intelligence Society) and also co-headed it for a few years. I liked playing soccer and was a member of National Sports Organization (2005-07).

Following my interest in image-processing, I went to [USC, Los Angeles](http://usc.edu) to purse Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering with focus on [brain imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging) with [Magnetic Resonance Imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging) (MRI). I developed a number of new methods for artifact-correction, coregistration and connectivity analysis with multi-contrast brain MRI images for [my Ph.D. Dissertation <i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>](http://neuroimage.usc.edu/~chitresh/files/chitresh_bhushan_dissertation_small.pdf). Several of my Ph.D. work have been [published](/publications/) in peer-reviewed journals and released as [software packages](/software/). Following my passion, I am pursuing a career in medical image/signal analysis and acquisition.

I occasionally write on [my technical-blog](http://flukylogs.blogspot.com/) about few issues I have encountered, which others have also found useful. I like to paint and sketch in my free time, some of which are shown below. I am fond of music, be it Eastern, Western or Classical. I also enjoy watching movies and trying out new cuisines.
