I am from [Patna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patna), capital city of state [Bihar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar), India.
I am passionate about image and signal processing, specially in medical applications.
I have worked on several related topics during my [under-graduate studies](/ugprojects/) and for my [<i class="fa fa-file-pdf" aria-hidden="true"></i> Ph.D. dissertation](http://neuroimage.usc.edu/~chitresh/files/chitresh_bhushan_dissertation_small.pdf).
Following my passion, I am pursuing a career in medical image/signal analysis and image acquisition.

I occasionally write on [my technical-blog](http://flukylogs.blogspot.com/). I like to paint, sketch & hiking in my free time.
